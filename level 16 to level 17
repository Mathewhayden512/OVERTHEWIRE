Bandit Level 16 → 17 Write-up

Goal
Obtain access to bandit17.
Unlike previous levels, the password is not a simple string — it is provided via an SSH private key exposed by a service running on localhost.

Step 1: Understand the Hint
The level hint says (paraphrased):
The credentials for the next level are available by connecting to services running on ports 31000–32000.

Step 2: Scan for Open Ports
You scanned the port range locally:
nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
This identifies which ports are listening and worth connecting to.

Step 3: Connect to the SSL Service
One of the open ports responds with data over SSL.
When you connect to it (using openssl s_client), instead of a password, it returns:

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
This is not random output — it is a valid SSH private key.

Key insight:
Bandit17 authenticates using SSH key-based authentication, not a password.

Step 4: Save the Private Key
On your local machine, you saved the key to a file:
vim key
Then you fixed the permissions:
chmod 400 key

Why this is required
SSH refuses to use private keys that are:
World-readable
Group-readable
Writable by others
chmod 400 ensures only you can read the key.

Step 5: SSH Using the Key
You then logged in using:
ssh -i key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Because:
The username is bandit17
The private key matches the server’s authorized key
Permissions are correct
SSH grants access without prompting for a password.

Step 6: Successful Login
You are now logged in as:
bandit17@bandit

This confirms the private key was valid and the level is solved.
