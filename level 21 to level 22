Bandit Level 21 → Level 22

After logging into Bandit Level 21, I knew that this level involved cron jobs,
so I navigated to the cron configuration directory:
cd /etc/cron.d

I listed the contents of the directory to see which cron jobs were available:
ls

Among the listed files, cronjob_bandit22 stood out. I opened this file to inspect its
contents:
cat cronjob_bandit22

The output showed that a script named /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh is executed every 
minute as user bandit22, as well as at system reboot:
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null

Next, I examined the script being executed by the cron job:
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh

The script contained the following commands:
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

From this, I understood that the cron job copies the password for bandit22 
from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 into a file located in /tmp/, and then changes its permissions
to be world-readable.
Since /tmp is accessible to all users, I simply read the contents of that file:
cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv

This revealed the password for the next level:
tRae0UfB9v0UzbCdn9cY0gQnds9GF58Q


After obtaining the password, I exited the session and logged into Bandit Level 22 using SSH:
ssh bandit22@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


I entered the retrieved password, and the login was successful, confirming that the cron job had been used correctly to access the next level.
