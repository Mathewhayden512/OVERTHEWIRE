Bandit Level 17 → Level 18

In this level, I was given two files: passwords.old and passwords.new. The task was to find the password for the next level by comparing these two files.
To do this, I used the diff command:
diff passwords.old passwords.new


The output showed that line was different in both files:
42c42
< BMIOFKM7CRSLI97voLp3TD80NAq5exxk
---
> x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO

This means the old password was replaced with a new one. Since the correct password is the updated value, I took the string from passwords.new:
x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO

After noting down the password, I exited the current session and logged into the next level using SSH:
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

I entered the new password when prompted. The login was successful, and I reached Bandit
Level 18, confirming that the password obtained from the diff command was correct.
