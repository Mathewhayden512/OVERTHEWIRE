Bandit Level 19 → Level 20

After logging into Bandit Level 19, I listed the files in the home directory:
ls

I found a file named bandit20-do. To understand what kind of file it was, I checked it using:
file bandit20-do

The output showed that bandit20-do is a setuid ELF executable.
I then verified its permissions:
ls -l bandit20-do


The permissions included the setuid bit, and the file was owned by user bandit20. 
This indicated that the program runs with bandit20’s privileges, even when executed by
bandit19.
When I ran the program without arguments, it displayed a help message:
./bandit20-do

It explained that the program allows running a command as another user.
To confirm this behavior, I executed:
./bandit20-do whoami

The output was:
bandit20

This confirmed that commands run through bandit20-do execute as the bandit20 user.

Knowing that Bandit passwords are stored in /etc/bandit_pass/, I used the program to read the
password file for bandit20:
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
This command revealed the password for the next level:
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO


After obtaining the password, I exited the session and logged into Bandit Level 20 using SSH:
ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


I entered the retrieved password, and the login was successful. This confirmed that the setuid executable was used correctly to escalate privileges and access the next level.
