Bandit Level 18 → Level 19

In Bandit Level 18, logging in normally does not give an interactive shell because the session 
exits immediately after login. To bypass this, I executed a command directly while connecting
via SSH.

I used the following command to read the readme file during login:
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme

When prompted, I entered the Level 18 password. Instead of logging out immediately, the 
command was executed, and the contents of the readme file were displayed. This file 
contained the password for the next level:
cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8

After obtaining the password, I logged into Bandit Level 19 using SSH:
ssh bandit19@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

I entered the retrieved password, and the login was successful.
This confirmed that the password obtained from the readme file was correct, and
I was able to access Bandit Level 19.
