Bandit Level 15 → 16 

Goal
Retrieve the password for bandit16 by connecting to a service running on localhost:30001 using SSL/TLS.

Key Hint from the Level

> The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

So:
* Plain `nc` will not work
* You must use an SSL/TLS client

Tool Used
`openssl s_client`
This tool allows you to manually establish an SSL/TLS connection and interact with the service.

Command Used
bash openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001

What Happens During Connection

1. TLS Handshake

   * The server presents a self-signed certificate (`CN = SnakeOil`)
   * OpenSSL reports:
     verify error:num=18:self-signed certificate
   * This is expected and safe for this challenge

2. Secure Connection Established

   * TLS version: TLSv1.3
   * Cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
   * Connection is encrypted despite the warning

3. Manual Input Phase

   *After the handshake, the server waits for input
   * You paste the Bandit15 password
   * The server validates it

4. Server Response

   * On success, the server prints:
     Correct!
     <password-for-bandit16>
   * The connection then closes

Why the Certificate Warning Can Be Ignored

* The challenge uses a self-signed cert
* You are connecting to `localhost`
* Certificate validation is irrelevant here because:
 * No MITM risk
 * You only need encrypted transport

Result
* The server returns the Bandit16 password
* You successfully log in using:
bash ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
